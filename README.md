MLS soccer- winner predictor- NLP
 
Dataset is continuous and target we are trying to predict is classification problem so using supervised model will be good for prediction which includes,
 
Random forest
Logistics regression(for binary classification)
Gradient boosting
And SVM etc.
 
In all of them I tried all and found SVM is working little better on test data,
 
Its hard to make good accuracy model for soccer match winner prediction so I am getting very low accuracy but I believe with some time and good data source and also some expert advice we can achieve good accuracy.
 
FOR FINAL MODEL GO TO VERY END OF NOTEBOOK FILE.
